## r-travis

This repository is a fork of the (deprecated) [r-travis](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis)
repository by Craig Citro et al.  I was an early contributor to this project, and quite like its design and
features -- so I am keeping it around.

### Usage

Several of my package rely on this repo, see their respective `.travis.yml` files.

### More

See the [public webpage for r-travis](http://eddelbuettel.github.io/r-travis/) for more.

### Alternatives

See for example the [official Travis support for R](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r/).
